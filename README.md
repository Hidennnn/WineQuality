## Description
Thanks the project I learnt about EDA and build models in 
sklearn for category prediction. 

## Database
In the project I worked with the Wine Quality database. 
Project's goal was prediction of quality of wine. I split
the project on 2 parts.

1. Predict if a wine is good or bad.
2. Predict detailed wine's quality.

## Results

### *1st part*
In 1st part RandomForestClassifier achieved the best results.

**Params**:
- *n_estimators:* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;442
- *criterion:* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; log_loss
- *max_depth:* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;None
- *min_samples_leaf:* &nbsp; 2
- *min_samples_split:* &nbsp;4

**Accuracy**: 85%

**Precision**:
- *good*: &nbsp;85%
- *bad*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85%

**Recall**:
- *good*: &nbsp;80%
- *bad*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87%

### *2nd part*
In the 2nd part I used the same model and the same params
which was the best in 1st part.

**Accuracy**: 70%

**Precision**:
- *0*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%
- *1*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%
- *2*: &nbsp;73%
- *3*: &nbsp;68%
- *4*: &nbsp;64%
- *5*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%

**Recall**:
- *0*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%
- *1*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%
- *2*: &nbsp;81%
- *3*: &nbsp;77%
- *4*: &nbsp;50%
- *5*: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%

## Summary

The model works quite good for grouped cases,
but not for detailed groups. Even if accuracy
is about 70%, the model has problems with 
other quality than 2 and 3.
